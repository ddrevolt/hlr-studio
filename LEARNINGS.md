- Figma: the cloud connector refuses files shared view-only, even with a Full seat on your own team, and whoami still passes. The start-of-session check has to call get_metadata on the real file. The fix is a copy in a team you edit.
- Figma desktop: the Dev Mode MCP Server toggle was not under Preferences in Eddie's Figma desktop. Not pursued.
- The brand book (June 2022) predates the rename: marks and posts since mid-2023 say High Light Rituals. Date every source; an older book is evidence, not law.
- Logo SVGs from different years carry different blacks (#353535 in 2022, #231f20 in 2024). Read the fills in every SVG, not only the palette page.
- The IG archive's file names hold caption openers and post dates: a 36-line organic corpus before Figma opens.
- The installed engine names other registered brands in all 10 skill descriptions. A client-run bundle needs a brand-free release, so the census covers the engine, not only the pack.
- The site is Shopify: `/products.json` and `/collections.json` give the public catalog in two calls. Neither shell can reach the site; the built-in browser can, and a pull that size goes to disk by parsing the session's own record of the tool result, never by re-typing it.
- The book (2022) and the site (2025 theme) disagree on positioning, ink and CTA shape. Read the live site before ratifying anything from a book.
- use_figma returns at most 20 KB; anything bigger fails and commits nothing. Use it for aggregates (font and fill counts) and get_metadata for bulk reads: past the token limit the result is saved under tool-results/, where a regex pass reads it.
- The client's files carry no styles, variables or components (only 6 instances of a remote Logo). Every value is hard-coded, so observed tokens come from counts, not from a library.
- The copy grew between reads (email went from 304 to 527 frames). Re-read once the owner says the copy is complete.
- Cost: not measured.
